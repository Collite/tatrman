# The MD (multidimensional) model

The **MD model** describes data the way an analyst thinks about it: *measures*
(the numbers you sum) sliced by *dimensions* (the things you slice by). It is a
**logical** layer — it says what a cube *means*, not which table it lives in —
and a separate **binding** layer ties it to physical `db` tables (or, read-only,
to `er` entities).

MD lives in its own schema:

```ttrm
schema md
```

and the four binding kinds live under `schema binding` (the same schema the
`er2db_*` mappings use — see [Mapping](08-mapping.md)).

> MD is grammar **3.1**, additive over 3.0. Every MD keyword is also a valid
> identifier fragment, so adding MD never changes the meaning of an existing
> model.

## The seven logical objects

| Object | What it is |
|---|---|
| `def domain` | a value set (a measure's type, or a dimension attribute's range) |
| `def dimension` | an axis you slice by, with inline attributes and a `key` |
| `def map` | a function between domains (`N:1` by default) — calc-backed or table-backed |
| `def hierarchy` | an ordered drill path of a dimension's attributes (leaf→root) |
| `def measure` | a number, with an aggregation and an additivity class |
| `def cubelet` | a grain (set of dimension attributes) + the measures defined at it |

### Domains

A domain is a value set. A **scalar** domain (a measure's value type) is just a
`type`; a **member-set** or **calc** domain adds `kind` and a `restrict`:

```ttrm
def domain Money     { type: decimal }                                  // scalar
def domain Day       { type: date }                                     // a calendar leaf
def domain Month     { type: int, kind: calc, restrict: { range: 1..12 } }
def domain AccountKind {
  type: string,
  kind: bound,                                                          // members come from a table
  restrict: { members: { "A": { en: "Asset" }, "L": { en: "Liability" } } }
}
```

- `kind: calc` — values are *computed* (e.g. month-of-date). Only on discrete
  types; `kind` on a continuous `decimal`/`float` is rejected
  (`md/kind-on-scalar`).
- `kind: bound` — members come from a real table; you **must** supply an
  `md2db_domain` source (`md/bound-domain-no-source`).
- `restrict: { range: 1..12 }` uses the `..` range literal. `members` is only
  valid on a discrete type.

### Dimensions and attributes

A dimension owns its attributes inline and names one `key`:

```ttrm
def dimension Customer {
  key: code,
  attributes: [
    def attribute code { domain: md.CustomerCode, isKey: true },
    def attribute name { domain: md.CustomerName }
  ],
  hierarchies: [geo]
}
```

The `attribute` body is **shared** with ER, but the rules differ by schema: an
MD attribute **must** carry `domain:` and **must not** carry `type:`
(`md/attr-needs-domain`, `md/attr-type-in-md`); an ER attribute is the reverse
(`er/attr-domain-in-er`).

### Maps

A map is a function between domains. A **calc** map references the built-in
catalog; an **absent** `calc:` means the map is **table-backed** (its cases come
from an `md2db_map`):

```ttrm
def map ts_to_day    { from: md.Timestamp, to: md.Day,   calc: truncToDay }   // calc
def map day_to_month { from: md.Day,       to: md.Month, calc: monthOfDate }
def map cc_to_building { from: md.CostCenterCode, to: md.BuildingCode,
                         cardinality: { from: "N", to: "1" } }                // table-backed
```

Calc maps with parameters use **named arguments**:

```ttrm
def map day_to_fy { from: md.Day, to: md.FiscalYear, calc: fiscalYearOfDate(fiscalYearStartMonth: 4) }
```

The catalog (the [Time calc-map catalog](../../features/md/map-catalog.md))
ships truncation (`truncToDay`/`Month`/`Quarter`/`Year`/`Week`), extraction
(`monthOfDate`, `quarterOfDate`, `yearOfDate`, `dayOfMonth`, `weekOfYear`) and
roll-up (`quarterOfMonth`) families. The editor checks the name
(`md/unknown-calc-map`), the args (`md/bad-calc-args`), and that the `from`/`to`
domains satisfy the signature (`md/calc-type-mismatch`). A calc map is implicitly
`N:1`; an explicit `1:1` conflicts (`md/calc-cardinality-conflict`).

### Hierarchies

A hierarchy lists a dimension's attributes **leaf→root**. The connecting map
between consecutive levels is **inferred**; `via` pins it when ambiguous:

```ttrm
def hierarchy calendar {
  dimension: md.Time,
  levels: [day, month via md.day_to_month, quarter via md.month_to_qtr]
}
```

Zero connecting maps → `md/no-hierarchy-step`; more than one and no `via` →
`md/ambiguous-hierarchy-step`; a level not in the dimension → `md/level-not-in-dim`.

### Measures

A measure has a value `domain`, an `aggregation`, and an additivity `class`
(default `additive`):

```ttrm
def measure net     { domain: md.Money, class: additive, aggregation: sum }
def measure balance {
  domain: md.Money,
  class: semiAdditive,
  aggregation: { default: sum, time: latestValid },
  validBy: asOf
}
```

A semi-additive latest-valid override **requires** `validBy`
(`md/semiadditive-no-validby`). A non-additive measure is mark-only in v1.

### Cubelets

A cubelet is a **grain** (a set of `Dimension.attribute`s) plus the measures
defined at it:

```ttrm
def cubelet sales {
  grain: [Customer.code, Product.code, Time.day],
  measures: [net, balance]
}
```

Every grain ref must resolve (`md/grain-ref-unknown`); a grain attribute that is
strictly coarser than another in the same grain is flagged (`md/grain-not-leaf`,
advisory).

## Binding the model to physical tables

The logical model says *what*; the `schema binding` defs say *where*.

### `md2db_cubelet` — wide and long

```ttrm
schema binding

def md2db_cubelet sales_fact {
  cubelet: md.sales,
  target: db.dbo.SALES_FACT,
  shape: wide,                                  // one column per measure
  attributes: { Customer.code: CUST_CODE, Time.day: TXN_DATE },
  measures: { net: NET_AMT, balance: BAL_AMT },
  journaling: overwrite
}
```

A **long** fact table carries measures as `(code, value)` rows:

```ttrm
def md2db_cubelet drivers_fact {
  cubelet: md.otherDrivers,
  target: db.dbo.DRIVERS,
  shape: { long: { codeColumn: DRIVER_CODE, valueColumn: AMOUNT } },
  attributes: { CostCenter.code: CC_CODE, Time.month: PERIOD },
  measures: { fte: { code: FTE }, m2: { code: M2 } }
}
```

The measure-binding form must match the shape — a `{code}` under `wide` (or a
bare column under `long`) is `md/shape-measure-mismatch`. The bound `attributes`
must cover the cubelet's grain. An attribute can be reached **through a map**:

```ttrm
attributes: {
  Building.code: { via: md.cc_to_building, from: { table: db.dbo.CC_MAP, column: BUILDING } }
}
```

**Journaling** declares writeback: `overwrite`, `diff`, or
`{ invalidate: { validColumn: VALID_TO } }`. When journaling is present, every
measure must be bound (`md/incomplete-journaling`). **Multi-source** is several
`md2db_cubelet` defs for one cubelet; their bound grain must agree
(`md/multisource-grain-mismatch`).

### `md2db_domain` and `md2db_map`

```ttrm
def md2db_domain account_kind_src {
  domain: md.AccountKind,                        // must be kind: bound
  source: { table: db.dbo.ACCOUNTS, column: KIND }
}

def md2db_map cc_building_map {
  map: md.cc_to_building,                         // must be table-backed (no calc)
  target: db.dbo.CC_BUILDING,
  columns: { CostCenterCode: CC_COL, BuildingCode: BLDG_COL }
}
```

`md2db_domain` on a non-`bound` domain is `md/source-on-unbound-domain`;
`md2db_map` on a calc map is `md/binding-on-calc-map`; `columns` must cover every
`from`/`to` domain (`md/map-columns-incomplete`).

### `md2er_cubelet` — structural only

A read-oriented md→er binding is **structural only** — it maps grain attributes
to ER attributes and carries no physical shape/journaling/measures:

```ttrm
def md2er_cubelet sales_er {
  cubelet: md.sales,
  target: er.entity.Sale,
  attributes: { Customer.code: customerCode, Time.day: saleDate }
}
```

A physical prop here is `md/md2er-physical-prop`.
