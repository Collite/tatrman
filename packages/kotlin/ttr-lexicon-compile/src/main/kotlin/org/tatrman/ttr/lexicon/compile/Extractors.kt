 * resolution. This extractor consumes desugared output when `ttr-semantics` surfaces it. Recorded

/**
 * METADATA layer, md half (RV-P3.4 T3) — the labels on md **dimension attributes**.
 *
 * A separate extractor from [MetadataExtractor] because md is a separate model: `ttr-metadata`'s
 * `Model` covers db/er/cnc and its `SchemaCode` has no `MD`, so no md object ever reaches that
 * walk. Without this, an estate whose nouns are md-owned — hartland's are, nearly all of them —
 * gets a METADATA layer that silently stops at its er tables.
 *
 * **Reads the parsed defs, not `MdModel`, and that is deliberate.** `MdModel` is a symbol graph
 * with no source spans; `DimensionDef`/`AttributeDef` carry `source`, so rows harvested here get a
 * real file AND line, which is what an author needs when a label collides. The ref spellings come
 * from [MdRefs], shared with the index, so the harvest and the resolution cannot drift apart.
 *
 * ## What is NOT harvested, and why it is not a deferral
 *
 * **Measures, dimensions and cubelets have no `displayLabel` in the grammar** — `MeasureDef`,
 * `DimensionDef` and `CubeletDef` carry `description` only, and a description is a sentence for a
 * human reading the model, which [MetadataExtractor] already refuses to admit as a term. So there
 * is nothing to harvest for them: closing that gap is a GRAMMAR change (a `displayLabel` on those
 * defs), not a compiler one. Estates name their measures through the DECLARED layer meanwhile —
 * `def term { for: md.measure.revenue, forms: [...] }` — which is the surface hartland already uses.
 *
 * `valueLabelAliases` (the A4-β per-value `aliases`) is also skipped, to stay at parity with the er
 * half, which does not harvest them either. Widening that is one change across both tiers, not a
 * quiet asymmetry introduced here.
