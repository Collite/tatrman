/**
 * The E-1/EQ-1 emit-plugin SPI (contracts §8, PL-P5.S1). A plugin owns the **orchestration layer only** — it
 * renders the per-target launcher/flow (bash `run.sh`, a Kestra/Airflow flow, …) from the projected
 * [OrchestrationGraph]; the island/transfer payloads are handed in **finished** ([EmitRequest.islandPayloads])
 * and MUST be emitted byte-verbatim (the core has already written them, so a plugin normally references them by
 * path and never re-materialises them).
 *
 * **Discovery.** Hosts load plugins via `java.util.ServiceLoader` — each plugin jar ships a
 * `META-INF/services/org.tatrman.ttrp.emit.spi.TtrEmitPlugin` entry and a no-arg constructor — in an isolated
 * classloader (the compiler core's classpath never leaks into a plugin).
 *
 * **Determinism is a CONTRACT obligation.** Same [EmitRequest] ⇒ byte-identical [EmitResult]. No timestamps, no
 * random ids, no env reads, no filesystem/network access — the request is the plugin's ONLY input (there are no
 * ambient handles on this interface). Verified by the H-6 determinism kit (`ttrp conform emit-determinism`).
 *
 * The bash emitter is **extracted** as the proving plugin (`org.tatrman:ttr-emit-bash`): the SPI is proven by
 * extraction, not invented — if bash cannot be byte-identical to the pre-extraction emitter, the surface is wrong.
